# airline-reservation-system

I made this for one of my classes. It's pretty okay.

Some things it's not:
* secure
* comprehensive
* secure

No, but seriously this is not secure. I *could* make it secure, but I have neither the time nor the motivation to do that.

Start it by running initial.py. You'll need the [MySQL connector](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/) for Python 3.4, and the tkinter library.
